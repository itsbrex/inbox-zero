<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is encountering two module resolution errors:
1. `next-flight-client-entry-loader` can't be resolved
2. `@swc/helpers/package.json` can't be found

These are typically dependency issues that can be resolved by:
1. Clearing the Next.js cache (.next folder)
2. Reinstalling node_modules
3. Potentially updating or reinstalling specific packages

Let me check the package.json to understand the project structure and then try to fix these issues.

These are typically cache/dependency corruption issues. Let me fix them by cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies.
